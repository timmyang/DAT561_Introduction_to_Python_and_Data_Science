    "The first code block contains the poem O Captain! my Captain! I have replaced all the new line characters with blanks for you (.replace(\"\\n\",\"\")). Run this block of code and then run the line of code with just the variable poem in it to view the poem after this update.  The next block of code contains a list of \"stop words\", which are common words that don't provide much use in textual analysis. Run this block to create the variable stop_words. Your goal is to build a dictionary whose keys are the stop words that appear in the poem, with associated values that are counts of the number of times this stop word appears. To check your answer you should get 18 \"the\" and 2 \"won\" (among all the other counts). Hint: the string method .lower() could be useful to put everything in lowercase."
